A VR game in unity for HTC VIVE

The goal is to throw a ball to catch all the stars and hit the target in one throw.
To achieve this you have at your disposal a few objects : a metal plank, a conveyor belt, a fan, a pipe and a trampoline.

##Next steps
As a next iteration, this game would need a main menu to jump to a particular level,
some sound effects, more tools, a level editor etc...
